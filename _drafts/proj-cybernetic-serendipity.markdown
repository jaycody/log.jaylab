## What was it?
Cybernetic Serendipity was an exhibition of cybernetic art curated by Jasia Reichardt, shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London in 1968,[1] and then touring the United States. Two stops in the US were the Corcoran Annex (Corcoran Gallery of Art), Washington, D.C., and the newly opened Exploratorium[2] in San Francisco.
