## The Magnetic Touch Illusion
This week, Karolinska Institutet's Department of Neuroscience published a paper about the mechanisms and manipulation of **bodily self-attribution**
multisensory integration within peripersonal space underlies bodily self-attribution.**  
Furthermore, we propose that **the magnetic touch illusion constitutes a perceptual correlate of visuotactile integration in peripersonal space.**


### Abstract from The Magnetic Touch Illusion 

> To accurately localize our limbs and guide movements toward external objects, the brain must represent the body and its surrounding **(peripersonal) visual space**. Specific multisensory neurons encode peripersonal space in the monkey brain, and **neurobehavioral studies** have suggested the existence of a similar representation in humans. However, because peripersonal space lacks a distinct perceptual correlate, its involvement in spatial and bodily perception remains unclear.   
**Here, we show that applying brushstrokes in mid-air at some distance above a rubber hand—without touching it—in synchrony with brushstrokes applied to a participant’s hidden real hand results in the illusory sensation of a ‘‘magnetic force” between the brush and the rubber hand, which strongly correlates with the perception of the rubber hand as one’s own.**   
In eight experiments, we characterized this ‘‘**magnetic touch illusion**” by using quantitative subjective reports, motion tracking, and behavioral data consisting of pointing errors toward the rubber hand in an intermanual pointing task. We found that the **illusion depends on visuo-tactile synchrony** and exhibits similarities with the visuo-tactile receptive field properties of peripersonal space neurons, featuring a **non-linear decay at 40 cm that is independent of gaze direction and follows changes in the rubber hand position.** Moreover, the ‘‘magnetic force” does not penetrate physical barriers, thus further **linking this phenomenon to body-specific visuo-tactile integration processes.**   
These findings provide strong support for the notion that **multisensory integration within peripersonal space underlies bodily self-attribution.**  
Furthermore, we propose that **the magnetic touch illusion constitutes a perceptual correlate of visuotactile integration in peripersonal space.**
