## Confirmation of Mixed Reality Therapy 
I'm always on the lookout for confirmation of the principles underlying my mixed-reality therapy project, aka:
  - [Interactive Healing Spaces](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaycody9/albums/72157637800982304)
  - Responsive Guided Imagery
  - [Recursion Projection therapy](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jaycody9/albums/72157625517220234)
  - etc etc etc...what's in a name anyway?

Well, today after reading Kevin Kelley's [Magic Leap article from the May 2016 issue of Wired](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/magic-leap-vr/), I spent some time checking out vids and posts about Magic Leap and mixed reality. 

Peter Rubin, editor at Wired, simplifies the current state in his vid/post, [AR, VR, MR: Making Sense of Magic Leap and the Future of Reality](http://www.wired.com/2016/04/differences-between-vr-mr-ar/)

But it was [Wired Magazine senior staff writer Jessi Hempel on CBS news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yumCpRXouFw) that delivered the goods with a story of her experience at Magic Leap headquarters.  At 2.5 minutes into the video she describes a firefly landing on her finger:
> and the crazy thing was, that I felt it....

'Crazy' bc the firefly was a virtual object, but crazier bc, as Jessi goes on to explain, she'd lost feeling in that finger years ago in an accident.

To this the show host added:
> So your brain just thought you were feeling it.

Jessi's response:
> Exactly! Exactly!


# **EXACTLY**

### further reading:
#### see Kant's ideas on the synthetic unity of apperception in his [Critique of Pure Reason](http://files.libertyfund.org/files/1442/0330_Bk.pdf)
##### my simplified version:
- Imagine you're standing on [Universal City's 'Colonial Street'](http://www.retroweb.com/universal_leave_it_to_beaver.html) in front of the Beaver's house, yes, the Beaver, from [Leave it to Beaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB2CZxdqXh4).  You look up and see *a house*, the Beaver's house, but the houses on this street are not houses at all, they're hollywood facades. The process by which your mind generates *a house* from a mere facade is what Kant refers to as **the synthetic unity of apperception**. Your imagination produces for you *a house* by unifying your sensory input (the image of the facade) with your expectations and assumptions of what houses are. Your mind fills in the blanks.  
- I think Kant would argue that the same process was at work in Jessi Hempel's experience of a firefly landing on her finger.  Magic Leaps firefly facade landed on her finger, and Jessi's mind rushed in to synthesize a unity between her mental models and her sensations.  
  
##### and as brought to us by [G. J. Mattey's lecture notes on Transcendental Deduction in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason](http://hume.ucdavis.edu/mattey/phi175/trdedlec.html)

- transcendental synthesis of imagination 
> If the figurative synthesis succeeds in uniting a manifold of pure intuition under one self-consciouness, then it is automatically subject to the categories, and it gets a new name: “However, when the figurative synthesis concerns merely the original synthetic unity of apperception, i.e., merely this transcendental unity of thought in the categories, then it must be called the **transcendental synthesis of imagination**, to distinguish it from the merely intellectual combination” (B151). This is the vital link between concept and intuition. The two are brought together by the unity of consciousness on the side of concept and the synthesis of the pure manifold by the imagination on the side of intuition. “This synthesis is an action of the understanding upon sensibility, and is the understanding‘s first application (and at the same time the basis of all its other applications) to objects of the intuition that is possible for us” (B152).

- apperception
> Kant calls self-presentation in general “apperception.” The term was originally coined by Leibniz. (See New Essays Concerning Human Understanding, where **“apperceptions” are perceptions of perceptions**, whose absence explains unperceived “little perceptions” and innate ideas.)

- transcendental apperception
> the self-presentation that must be capable of being attached to all my presentations is called **transcendental apperception**. It is also called “original apperception,” “for it is the self-consciousness which, because it produces the presentation I think that must be capable of accompanying all other presentations and is one and the same in all consciousness, cannot be accompanied by any further presentation” (B132). A further reason for calling this kind of apperception original is that it alone among all presentations is capable of accompanying all others.

- synthetic unity of apperception (aka, **the unity of synthesis in one consciousness**)
>  it is the activity of the understanding which combines or synthesizes this manifold into a unity. It is this unity which elevates the manifold to the level of a cognition, or presentation of an object.
> In order for me to combine the manifold into a synthetic unity, there must be a single “I” which does the combining. This is what Kant calls the **synthetic unity of apperception**. A better expression might be “**unity of synthesis in one consciousness**.” Kant claimed that this unity is a necessary condition for the “analytic unity of apperception.” This is the unity introduced previously: the presentation of the self as that to which all my presentations are presented. Kant thought that the unity of synthesis in one consciousness is fundamental. He says that “the principle of this unity [is] the supreme principle in all of human cognition” (B135). Further,
>> _The synthetic unity of apperception is the highest point, to which we must attach all use of the understanding , even the whole of logic, and in accordance with it transcendental philosophy; indeed, this power is the understanding itself._ (B134)

- the unity of transcendental apperception
>Since there is only one “I think” that must accompany all my presentations, apperception is unified. So Kant will speak of the **transcendental unity of apperception**. This is not a kind of object, but rather a feature of transcendental apperception. It might be called more straightforwardly **the unity of transcendental apperception**. Kant then describes this unity as “original combination” and says that from it “much can be inferred” (B133). The combination seems to be **"the condition under which alone [my presentations] can stand together in one self-consciousness.""**

- productive imagination and figurative synthesis
> When the figurative synthesis “concerns merely the original synthetic unity of apperception,” it is called transcendental synthesis (B151). The idea here is that if we unify times into one time, we necessarily bring it into a single consciousness. The **figurative synthesis** is the product of the imagination, which, though spontaneous, itself “belongs to sensibility” (B151). Kant sometimes refers to **the imagination in its role of carrying out the figurative synthesis as the “productive imagination,”** as opposed to the “reproductive imagination,” which is not spontaneous and follows empirical laws of association—the laws to which Hume had called attention (B152). The reproductive imagination plays no role in the transcendental deduction.
