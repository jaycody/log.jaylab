### General Idea for [jaylab.io](http://jaylab.io) splash page:
![jaylab]({{log.jaylab.io}}/assets/gifs/2016_06-jaylab_03-GIF.gif)

### Steps so far:
1. used Processing sketch to scribble 'jaylab' into a fading feedback loop
2. saved frames during the animation
3. used Processing's movie maker to reassemble the .tiffs

### Still to do:
4. add the .mov file in the splash screen
    - use p5.js
    - map mouseX to the playback position
    
    
### NOTES:
- why is not my markdown rendered??!!
- bc the '#' need an empty space before the string. works now.
