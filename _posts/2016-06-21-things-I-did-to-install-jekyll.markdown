While installing jekyll, I used nvAlt to keep a log of the install process.  After installing Jekyll, I copied the nvAlt log entry to jekyll as my first post.  Seemed fitting.  Here it is.  Hopefully the markdown transfers correctly.

....and, of course nvAlt's markdown didn't transfer correctly!  Maybe I should just insert a screenshot of the log entry, or use nvAlt to post the entry to peg.gd then snap a screenshot with Chrome's Full Page Screencapture plugin...

Okay, here it is...
