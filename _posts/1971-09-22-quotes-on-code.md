## Why?

[Because even cliches can be inspirational][5].

[Or not][4]

And also, why not! We're not ones to shy away from overkill. [Buy a goddamn big car!][3] This is a LOG, right? Let's log things the [Walt Whitman way, endlessly and without regard for relevance to anyone else but ourselves][1].  



And what I assume you shall assume, which is to say, in this catalogue of quotes, you will find not one of the [21 forbidden cliched inspirational quotes that everyone should forget][2], though, I warn, I won't hesitate to catalogue a cliche if it so moves me. 

You've been advised. Move along, move along.

- A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. - Doug Linder



#### Marijin Haverbeke from [Eloquent Javascript]

- A program is a building of thought.    
 
- What hostility to the richness of programming--to try to reduce it to something straight forward and predictable and to place a taboo on all the weird and beautiful programs! The landscape of programming techniques is enormous, fascinating in it diversity, and still largely unexplored.  It is certainly littered with traps and snares, luring the inexperienced programmer into all kinds of horrible mistakes, but that only means you should proceed with caution and keep your wits about you.  As you learn, there will always be new challenges and new territory to explore.  Programmers who refuse to keep exploring will surely stagnate, forget their joy, and lost their will to program (and become managers).
