## Why?

[Because even cliches can be inspirational][5].

[mostly][4]

And also, why not? We don't shy away from overkill! [Buy a goddamn big car!][3] This is a LOG, right? Let's log things the [Walt Whitman way, endlessly and without regard for relevance to anyone else but ourselves][1].  



So... what I assume you shall assume, which is to say, in this catalogue of quotes, we will find not one of the [21 forbidden cliched inspirational quotes that everyone should forget][2], though, be warned, we won't hesitate to catalogue a cliche if it so moves us. 

You've been advised.

### quotes of code, miscellaneous

- A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. - **Doug Linder**
- You should focus on being more interested than more interesting. 
- Spending a single development hour at this point on anything that doesn’t directly bring you closer to meeting priority number one is a waste. 
- **Creativity**: the act of resolving vision. 
- Beautiful People Make Their Own Laws.  
  - Vivien Leigh (Mrs. Stone) from an adaptation of **Tennessee Williams** - The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone
- It ain't the skill, it's the will.
- think not of the things undone after spring has passed..... - **xen kaein**
- The power of recursion evidently lies in the possibility of defining an infinite set of objects by a finite statement. In the same manner, an infinite number of computations can be described by a finite recursive program, even if this program contains no explicit repetitions.
- To make something truly great you need an excellent plan and not quite enough time. - Paraphrased by **Adam Savage** during his Maker Faire talk 2016
- I wonder whether fractal images are not touching the very structure of our brains. Is there a clue in the infinitely regressing character of such images that illuminates our perception of art? Could it be that a fractal image is of such extraordinary richness, that it is bound to resonate with our neuronal circuits and stimulate the pleasure I infer we all feel? - **P. W. Atkins**

### quotes of [Eloquent Javascript]
> from Marijin Haverbeke

- A program is a building of thought.    
 
- What hostility to the richness of programming--to try to reduce it to something straight forward and predictable and to place a taboo on all the weird and beautiful programs! The landscape of programming techniques is enormous, fascinating in it diversity, and still largely unexplored.  It is certainly littered with traps and snares, luring the inexperienced programmer into all kinds of horrible mistakes, but that only means you should proceed with caution and keep your wits about you.  As you learn, there will always be new challenges and new territory to explore.  Programmers who refuse to keep exploring will surely stagnate, forget their joy, and lose their will to program (and become managers).

### quotes of test

- If you can’t make something not work, keep on trying. - unknown
- Testing is not simply something we can just go do. It requires planning, preparation, strategy, and adaptable tactics for it to be performed successfully. 
  - [James Whittaker, Exploratory Software Testing][8]

### closing notes on the new or noteworthy:

#### On citing quote sources
- if the catalogued quote has no citation, the origin is unknown to me.
 
#### On Whitman:
- On [Whitman's lists][6]
  - "Lists that go on and on are one of Whitman's specialties. They define his poetic style. In [Song of Myself][1], he tries to contain the entire world within "Myself," the all mighty "I." This requires naming a whole lot of stuff that to which he belongs and with which he identifies. The technical term for these lists in poetry-speak is **"catalogue."** These **catalogues** often include many lines in a row that begin with the same word or phrase, which is called **anaphora.**"
- On **anaphora**:
  - the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses.
- **On the structural patterns of Song of Myself...**
  - they take their shape from the ideas they convey.
  - see, [The Structure of Whitman's 'Song of Myself']({{log.jaylab.io}}/assets/pdfs/quotes-structure_of_whitmans_SOM.pdf), Jane Kinney Hill's master's thesis for the University of Louisville's english department, 1949
- **On the agglutinative catalogue trend in literature:**
  - Whitman's use of the cumulative list is only his expression of a trend that
has moved through a number of pieces of great literature. (p60)
  - According to Hill's paper, "Some very good illustrations of this trend to catalogue are found in:   
    1. Homer's Iliad   
    - (11:494-876) where the catalogue  
of ships enumerates both sides of the forces that fought at
Troy;
    2. all four books of Virgil's Georgics. 
      - This, the most carefully finished production of Roman literature,
is an almanac-like agricultural catalogue.
    3. the genealogies of the Bible
    4. Francois Rabelais' The Inestimable Life of the Great Gargantua
      - chapter eight, the catalogue of wearing apparel
    5. Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene
      - (Canto 1, stanzas VII1-IX), the catalogue of trees 
    6. all of the works of Thomas Wolfe
      - example: the catalogue of historical events, Look Homeward, Angel, chapter IV
    7. all of the works of Carl Sandburg
      - example: the catalogue of heroes in the poem, "Good Morning, America," stanza
    8. [Quotes on Code](http://log.jaylab.io/notes/1971/09/22/quotes-on-code.html) from log.jaylab
      - with its pretentiously self-conscious pattern of anaphorically prepended 'quotes of' catalogue
